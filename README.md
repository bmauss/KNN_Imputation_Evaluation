This is an investigation into the effectiveness of using KNN Imputation on different datasets. 

KNN Imputation has become a very popular method for quickly dealing with missing data.  In this project, we'll be looking into the its effectiveness in estimating missing values against continuous and categorical data on two datasets: The Iris dataset and the Seattle Terry Stops Dataset.

## Objectives
* Calculate the RMSE of KNN Imputation on the Iris dataset.
* Calculate Accuracy of KNN Imputation on categorical data in the Terry Stops dataset.

## The Iris Dataset

For part one of this series of reports, we’ll be looking at the classic Iris dataset. This classification dataset makes for a good baseline. While it is small, the three classes (setosa, virginica, and versicolor) are perfectly balanced. The features (which are the measurements of the sepals and petals) are all continuous, which makes measuring accuracy much simpler. Best of all: it comes perfectly clean!

That being said, we still need to preprocess it for use with `KNNImputer`.

### Preprocessing

As far as preprocessing goes, it doesn’t take much. All that needs to be done is ensure that the `target` column is label encoded and then scale the data. Luckily, you can actually load the dataset with the `target` column already label encoded.
